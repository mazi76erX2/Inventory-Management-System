# Inventory-Management-System
Inventory Management System that allows users to manage inventory items through a user interface, backed by a RESTful API and a relational database. Using FastAPI and React


## Justifications

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is easy to use, fast to develop with, and provides automatic interactive API documentation.
- **OpenAPI**: OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs. Comes standard with FastAPI.
- **PostgreSQL**: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system that is widely used in production environments.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. I feel like using an ORM will make it easier to interact with the database and write queries especially for other developers who may not be familiar with SQL.
- **asyncpg**: asyncpg is a fast PostgreSQL database client library for Python. It is designed for use with the async/await syntax and provides support for asynchronous I/O operations.
- **React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **NextJS**: The React website recommends using a framework for building React applications, and Next.js is a popular choice that provides a lot of useful features out of the box. [React Start New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-built utility classes that can be used to style web applications. It is easy to use and provides a flexible way to style web applications.
- **Docker**: Docker is a popular tool for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. It provides a lightweight and portable way to package applications and their dependencies, which makes it easy to deploy applications in different environments.
- **Redis**: Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used to cache data and speed up applications. It is a popular choice for caching data in web applications and can be used to store the results of sentiment analysis requests.
